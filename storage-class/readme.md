## What is a storage class ?

A StorageClass in Kubernetes defines how storage (like disks, volumes, or network file systems) should be provisioned and managed for your pods.
Think of it as a template or blueprint that tells Kubernetes what type of storage to create when a pod requests Persistent Volume (PV) space.

In simple words:

A StorageClass = “recipe” for dynamically creating storage volumes with specific properties (like SSD vs HDD, encrypted vs non-encrypted, EBS vs EFS, etc.).

# EBS


### ⚙️ Why Do We Need a StorageClass?

Without a StorageClass, you would have to:

Manually create PersistentVolumes (PVs).

Manually bind each PV to a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).

With a StorageClass:
✅ Kubernetes can automatically create the PV when a PVC requests it.
✅ You can have different types of storage for different workloads — for example:

Fast SSDs for databases

Cheaper HDDs for backups

Shared network storage for multiple pods

## Example

Let’s say you define a StorageClass for AWS EBS:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ebs-gp3-encrypted
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: gp3
  encrypted: "true"
  kmsKeyId: "abcd-1234-efgh-5678"
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

### 🔹 type: gp3
This tells AWS what kind of EBS volume to create.
gp3 = General Purpose SSD (third generation) — it offers a balance of cost and performance.

Other examples:

gp2 → older general SSD

io1 / io2 → provisioned IOPS (high-performance)

st1 → throughput-optimized HDD

sc1 → cold HDD

### 🔹 encrypted: "true"

Enables encryption at rest for the EBS volume.
AWS uses KMS (Key Management Service) for encryption.
Data is encrypted automatically when written to disk, and decrypted when read, with no performance penalty.


Significance:
Enhances data security and ensures compliance with standards like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.


### 🔐 What Does “Encryption at Rest” Mean?

“Encryption at rest” means your data is encrypted while it’s stored on disk (in EBS, S3, RDS, etc.), even when nobody is actively accessing it.Only when the data is read into memory (RAM) does it get decrypted — automatically — and only for authorized processes.

So, even if someone gets access to the physical disk, snapshots, or backups, they cannot read your data without the proper encryption key.



### now i have one doubt that lets say we defined a storage class and a pod from cluster demands volume through pvc then the dynamically formed pv is accessibled across all nodes in that ckluster?


🧱 Case 1: EBS (Block Storage) — NOT shared across nodes

When the PVC requests storage through a StorageClass that uses provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com,
→ AWS creates one EBS volume in one Availability Zone.

That volume can only be attached to one EC2 instance (node) at a time (unless in multi-attach mode, which is rare).



❌ No — an EBS-based PV is not accessible across all nodes.


Only the node that the pod is running on will get that volume attached to it.

If Kubernetes reschedules the pod to another node (still in the same AZ):

The control plane detaches the volume from the old node.

Then re-attaches it to the new node.

This can take a few seconds (you’ll often see pod stuck in “ContainerCreating” during attach/detach).

✅ So — only one node at a time can access it, but it can move across nodes (in same AZ).



# EFS

## 🧩 What Is an EFS StorageClass?


An EFS (Elastic File System) StorageClass in Kubernetes tells the cluster:

“When a PVC requests storage, dynamically create and mount a shared EFS file system from AWS.”

So instead of making a private EBS disk, it mounts a network file system (NFS) that multiple pods can share — even if they’re on different nodes or zones.


## 🗂️ Example — EFS StorageClass YAML


```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: aws-efs-sc
provisioner: efs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  provisioningMode: efs-ap
  fileSystemId: fs-0a1b2c3d4e
  directoryPerms: "777"
  gidRangeStart: "1000"
  gidRangeEnd: "2000"
  basePath: "/dynamic_provisioning"
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```


Field-by-Field Breakdown
1️⃣ provisioner: efs.csi.aws.com

This tells Kubernetes which CSI driver to use.
Here it’s the AWS EFS CSI driver, which knows how to:

Create access points

Mount EFS filesystems to pods

Manage directories and permissions

Think of this as “the plugin that understands how to talk to EFS.”

2️⃣ parameters: — Core config for EFS

Each field here controls how the EFS storage behaves 👇

🧩 fileSystemId: fs-0a1b2c3d4e

This is the EFS FileSystem ID created in AWS (through console or Terraform).

It tells Kubernetes which EFS filesystem to use for provisioning volumes.

💡 Example: If your team has one shared EFS per cluster, you’ll reuse this ID across many PVs.

directoryPerms: "777"

Sets permissions for the subdirectory inside EFS (when it’s created).

"777" = read/write/execute by everyone (owner, group, others).

Useful when you want multiple pods or users to have access.


### Use of file system id and why we dont have such thing in ebs??


🧩 The Core Difference:
EFS = pre-created, shared filesystem
EBS = dynamically created, one-time disk


🟢 EFS: “Use an existing shared storage”

An EFS filesystem is something you (or your infra team) create manually once in AWS.

It’s a single shared resource that can be used by many pods across the cluster.

Kubernetes does not create the EFS itself — it only creates folders or access points inside that EFS.

So, you must tell Kubernetes which EFS to use — that’s why you provide:


```
fileSystemId: fs-0123456789abcdef0
```


can pod from access the same efs??


✅ Yes, pods from another cluster can access the same EFS —
❌ But only if certain network and permission conditions are met.


⚙️ Step 1 — EFS lives inside a VPC

Every EFS filesystem in AWS belongs to a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).
It has mount targets — one per Availability Zone (AZ) — inside that VPC’s subnets.

So, EFS is not “global”; it’s VPC-scoped.

That means:

Pods (or EC2 nodes) can only mount that EFS if their cluster’s nodes can reach those mount targets over the network.

Step 2 — Network requirement

To access EFS, your EKS nodes must:

Be in the same VPC as the EFS, or

Be in a peered VPC (VPC peering or Transit Gateway connected).

EFS uses NFS (port 2049) to communicate.
So:

Security groups on the EFS mount targets must allow inbound NFS (2049) from the node security groups.

The node security groups must allow outbound NFS (2049) to EFS.

✅ Allowed

```
Cluster A nodes (VPC-A)
Cluster B nodes (VPC-A)
EFS (in VPC-A)
```
❌ Not allowed (by default)

```
Cluster A nodes (VPC-A)
Cluster B nodes (VPC-B)
EFS (in VPC-A)
```

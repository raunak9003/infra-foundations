## Example

Let’s say you define a StorageClass for AWS EBS:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ebs-gp3-encrypted
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: gp3
  encrypted: "true"
  kmsKeyId: "abcd-1234-efgh-5678"
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

### 🔹 type: gp3
This tells AWS what kind of EBS volume to create.
gp3 = General Purpose SSD (third generation) — it offers a balance of cost and performance.

Other examples:

gp2 → older general SSD

io1 / io2 → provisioned IOPS (high-performance)

st1 → throughput-optimized HDD

sc1 → cold HDD

### 🔹 encrypted: "true"

Enables encryption at rest for the EBS volume.
AWS uses KMS (Key Management Service) for encryption.
Data is encrypted automatically when written to disk, and decrypted when read, with no performance penalty.


Significance:
Enhances data security and ensures compliance with standards like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.


### 🔐 What Does “Encryption at Rest” Mean?

“Encryption at rest” means your data is encrypted while it’s stored on disk (in EBS, S3, RDS, etc.), even when nobody is actively accessing it.Only when the data is read into memory (RAM) does it get decrypted — automatically — and only for authorized processes.

So, even if someone gets access to the physical disk, snapshots, or backups, they cannot read your data without the proper encryption key.


# if data is encrypted then how the pod who needs it read it

🧠 First Principle — Encryption at Rest ≠ Encryption While In Use


When you set encrypted: "true" on a volume (like an AWS EBS),
it means:

Data is encrypted when stored on disk (at rest),
but is decrypted automatically when accessed by an authorized instance (while in use).

## kmsKeyId: "xxxx-1234-xxxx-5678"


Specifies which KMS encryption key to use for encrypting the volume.

You can use a customer-managed key (CMK) instead of AWS’s default one.

This gives you fine-grained control — for example, you can rotate, disable, or audit key usage.



CRUCIAL

## 🧾 reclaimPolicy: Delete


this defines what happens to the PersistentVolume (PV) once the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is deleted.

Delete → the underlying EBS volume is deleted automatically.

Retain → volume stays in AWS; PV is “released” but not deleted (you can reuse or inspect data).


# volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer


Immediate → EBS volume is created as soon as PVC is made (no matter where the pod will run).

WaitForFirstConsumer → provisioning waits until a pod actually schedules on a node.

In AWS (and most clouds), your Kubernetes cluster has nodes spread across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

```
us-west-2a
us-west-2b
us-west-2c
```

Each AZ is like a separate data center.
Now here’s the key:

⚠️ EBS volumes exist in one AZ only — they cannot be attached to nodes in another AZ.


that means:

A volume created in us-west-2a can only be mounted by nodes in 2a.

If your pod is scheduled on a node in 2b, it cannot attach that volume.

🧩 Problem With Immediate Mode

When you use:

```
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```
Kubernetes creates the EBS volume immediately when the PVC is made — before it knows which node your pod will run on.


So what can go wrong?

Let’s say:

You create a PVC.

The StorageClass immediately provisions an EBS volume — in, say, us-west-2a.

Later, your pod gets scheduled on a node in us-west-2b.

❌ Boom — EBS can’t attach across AZs → mount fails.

That’s why the default Immediate mode can cause cross-AZ errors in multi-zone clusters.

now what is istio ingress gateway external??

🚪 1. Istio Ingress Gateway (External)
🎯 Goal:

Understand how traffic enters the mesh from outside (e.g., user → productpage).

📘 Key Concepts:

Ingress Gateway = entry point for all external traffic into the mesh.

It’s basically an Envoy proxy, just like sidecars — but dedicated for north–south traffic (outside ↔ inside cluster).

VirtualService + Gateway together define routing:

Gateway → defines ports, protocols, and hostnames exposed.

VirtualService → defines where that traffic goes inside the mesh.


wait then why we use load balancer ??


We use a LoadBalancer in front of the Istio Ingress Gateway so that external clients (like browsers) can reach the gateway pod — because Kubernetes pods are inside a private network that you can’t access directly from the internet.


🧱 1. Where the Istio Ingress Gateway Actually Lives

The Istio Ingress Gateway is just a pod running inside your Kubernetes cluster, usually in the istio-system namespace.

It’s not directly reachable from outside the cluster — just like any other pod.

So even though the gateway is designed to handle external traffic,
it still needs a way for that traffic to physically reach it.



🌐 2. The Role of the LoadBalancer Service

When you install Istio, it creates a Kubernetes Service for the Ingress Gateway, like this:


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: istio-ingressgateway
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    name: http2
    targetPort: 8080
  - port: 443
    name: https
    targetPort: 8443
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
```
👉 What it does:

In cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), Kubernetes automatically provisions a cloud Load Balancer (like AWS ELB, GCP Load Balancer).

That LoadBalancer gets a public IP address.

All requests hitting that IP are forwarded to the IngressGateway pods inside the cluster.


```
[ Internet user ]
       ↓
[ Cloud Load Balancer ]
       ↓
[ Istio Ingress Gateway (Envoy pod in istio-system) ]
       ↓
[ Your internal services ]
```


ohk but then if istio ingress gateway external cannot be accesssed externally then why we need it


🧱 1. The LoadBalancer ≠ The Gateway

The LoadBalancer only does network plumbing, nothing more.

It’s a cloud-provided component (AWS, GCP, Azure).

It can forward TCP packets from the internet to a target inside your cluster.

But it doesn’t understand HTTP, routing, or security policies.

It’s like a doorman who just forwards whoever comes at the door —
he doesn’t check who they are, what they want, or where they should go.



🚪 2. The Istio Ingress Gateway — The “Real” Entry Point of the Mesh

Once the LoadBalancer passes the request into the cluster,
the Istio Ingress Gateway (an Envoy proxy) takes over.

This gateway is the intelligent, policy-enforced, observable, and secure entry into your service mesh.

Let’s visualize this:

```
[ User on Internet ]
        │
        ▼
   (Public IP)
[ Cloud LoadBalancer ]   ← just forwards TCP/HTTP packets
        │
        ▼
[ Istio IngressGateway (Envoy) ]  ← understands Istio routing, TLS, mTLS, JWT, headers
        │
        ▼
[ VirtualService + DestinationRule ]  ← Istio routing logic
        │
        ▼
[ Your internal services (productpage, ratings, etc.) ]

```

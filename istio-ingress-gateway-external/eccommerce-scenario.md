🏗️ Scenario Recap

You have an e-commerce app made up of several microservices:

login → catalog → cart → payment

and a simple product page (like in amazon sometimes we need any login to just view products)


⚙️ 1. “If we just have a LoadBalancer, anyone can access any microservice”

✅ Exactly right.

If you exposed each microservice like this:

```
kubectl expose deployment payment --type=LoadBalancer
kubectl expose deployment login --type=LoadBalancer
```

then every service gets its own public IP, and anyone on the internet can directly call:

```
https://payment.example.com
https://login.example.com
```

That’s:

🔓 Zero security

❌ No service-to-service authentication

❌ No centralized routing or monitoring

So yes — that’s unsafe and not how we want to run production systems.


🧠 2. “That’s why we have Istio Ingress Gateway — so that it can do mTLS checking”

✅ Exactly right again.

Istio Ingress Gateway acts as:

The secure entry point to your cluster

The component that can terminate TLS (accept HTTPS from browser)

And optionally start mTLS inside the mesh (gateway ↔ internal services)

So instead of each service having a public IP,
👉 only the Istio Ingress Gateway is exposed to the internet.

All other services (login, catalog, payment, etc.) remain internal.


🌍 3. “If product page is public, maybe LoadBalancer alone is enough?”

💡 Great reasoning — but here’s the small but important clarification:

Even for the public service (product-page),
you still don’t expose it directly with a LoadBalancer.

Instead, you let the Istio Ingress Gateway handle it, but with open access rules.

Let’s see why 👇


Routing Control

Even if product-page is public, you might still want:

Canary deployments (90% to v1, 10% to v2)

A/B testing (header-based routing)

Traffic mirroring

Rate limiting, caching, etc.

All of those are done in the gateway + VirtualService, not in a plain LoadBalancer.

Consistency

You don’t want different entry mechanisms for different services —
it’s better to have one consistent entry point for all traffic.

So even public pages go through the same gateway,
but with relaxed policies.

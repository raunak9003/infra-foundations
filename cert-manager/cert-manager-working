cert-manager is a Kubernetes controller that automates the entire lifecycle of TLS certificates.

That means:

It automatically requests, issues, renews, and stores TLS certificates — so you don’t ever have to run openssl or manually upload certificates again.


🚀 Why We Need It

Without cert-manager:

You’d manually generate a CSR

Send it to a CA

Wait for signing

Upload the certificate to Kubernetes as a Secret

Replace it every 3 months (since Let’s Encrypt certs expire quickly)

With cert-manager:
✅ It does all of that automatically for you
✅ It renews certs before expiry
✅ It integrates natively with Ingress, Services, and Secrets


WORKFLOW->

You create a Certificate CRD

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: my-service-cert
  namespace: default
spec:
  secretName: my-service-tls
  dnsNames:
    - my-service.example.com
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-prod
    kind: ClusterIssuer
```

cert-manager notices this new Certificate

It talks to the referenced Issuer or ClusterIssuer
(which defines how to get a certificate — self-signed, CA, or Let’s Encrypt)

cert-manager requests a certificate

It creates a CertificateRequest

Sends it to the CA (or Let’s Encrypt, via ACME protocol)

CA signs it → cert-manager stores it

When the signed certificate is received, cert-manager stores it in a Kubernetes Secret:

```yaml
data:
  tls.crt: <public cert>
  tls.key: <private key>
```

Automatic Renewal

cert-manager keeps watching expiration dates.

If the certificate is nearing expiry (default: 2/3 of lifetime passed), it renews automatically.


HOW CERT MANAGER GETS TO KNOW THAT A CERTIFICATE IS ABOUT TO EXPIRE??

A Kubernetes Secret of type kubernetes.io/tls contains two different things:

Field	Meaning
tls.key	The private key – used by your server to decrypt or sign data.
tls.crt	The certificate – the public part that’s been signed by a CA and includes metadata such as the expiry date (NotAfter).

🔑 The private key (tls.key) doesn’t contain expiry or identity information.
🧾 The certificate (tls.crt) does — and that’s what cert-manager reads.

🧠 What cert-manager actually does

When cert-manager checks a Secret:

It reads the value of tls.crt, not tls.key.

It decodes it from base64 → PEM → X.509 structure.

It parses that X.509 certificate to extract:

NotBefore (when it becomes valid)

NotAfter (when it expires)

Subject, Issuer, SANs, etc.

It compares NotAfter with the current time.

If the certificate is close to expiry (based on renewBefore or default thresholds),
cert-manager triggers a renewal flow — generating a new certificate but re-using the same private key (tls.key) unless configuration says otherwise





## ROLE OF CA INJECTOR->

🧠 The Situation
1️⃣ cert-manager webhook:

Checks that your YAML (like Certificate or Issuer) is valid.
→ “Structure looks good ✅”

Runs as an HTTPS service inside your cluster.

Has its own TLS certificate — signed by a CA certificate.

2️⃣ Kubernetes API server:

Talks to that webhook securely over HTTPS.

To trust it, the API server needs to know which CA signed that webhook’s certificate.

⚠️ The Problem

Over time:

cert-manager may renew or rotate the CA certificate.
(e.g., maybe it expired or was reissued)

The webhook now presents a new CA signature.

But the API server still has the old CA saved in its webhook configuration (caBundle).
So it says:

“Wait — I don’t recognize this new CA. I can’t trust this HTTPS connection ❌.”

That means even though the webhook is fine and your YAML structure is valid,
👉 the API server rejects the connection because the trust chain doesn’t match anymore.

🧩 Where cainjector Steps In

Here’s what happens next:

cert-manager renews the CA → stores it in a Secret.

cainjector notices the change (it’s watching that Secret).

It finds all the resources that depend on this CA (like the webhook configuration).

It updates their caBundle field with the new CA certificate.

Now the API server sees:

“Oh okay, this is the new CA signature — I trust it again ✅”

🧾 In Simple Words

“Webhook approved because the structure is correct, but the API server didn’t trust it because of an outdated CA. cainjector quickly updates the CA record so the API server can trust it again.”

That’s exactly how it works.


cainjector pod security policy clusterrole vs clusterrolebinding

now it is important for cainjector pods to follow pod security policy and it must only use it rather than modifying it and it being handled in clusterrole.

and in cluster role binding it basically gives permission to the service account of the pod to use the pod security policy.





## STATRTUP API CHECK

startup api check is basically is a check which is being carried out in order to check that the crds to be used are being formed or not before the cert-manager pod is formed and being used.

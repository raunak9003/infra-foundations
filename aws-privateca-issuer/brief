purpose of having aws pca

aws-privateca-issuer is a cert-manager extension controller that allows Kubernetes workloads to request and receive TLS certificates issued by AWS Private Certificate Authority (PCA).

Think of it like a bridge between:

cert-manager (which handles Kubernetes-side certificate automation)

AWS PCA (which actually signs certificates with a private CA managed in AWS)

Without it, cert-manager can only issue:

Self-signed certs

ACME/Let’s Encrypt certs

or use an internal CA (through its ca or vault issuers)

With this issuer, you get enterprise-grade, AWS-managed private certificates automatically issued and renewed inside Kubernetes.


## but why the aws pca will sign any certificate like this

🧩 1. AWS PCA is Your Private Certificate Authority

When you create an AWS Private CA, you own it — it’s not a public CA like Let’s Encrypt.
You can think of it as your company’s internal Root or Intermediate CA, hosted and managed by AWS.

So AWS PCA will only sign certificates for entities that are explicitly authorized to call its APIs under your AWS account.

🔐 2. Security Boundary — IAM Permissions

AWS PCA won’t just sign anything you throw at it.

When cert-manager (via the aws-privateca-issuer controller) wants to issue a cert, it calls:

```
acm-pca:IssueCertificate
acm-pca:GetCertificate
acm-pca:DescribeCertificateAuthority
```
But those calls only succeed if the IAM Role that cert-manager’s service account is using has permissions for that specific PCA ARN.

}
```

## now if we dont have aws pca then whats the issue cert manager will itself sign it

🧩 What happens if you don’t use AWS PCA

Yes — you’re right that cert-manager can issue and sign certificates on its own, but how it does that depends on which issuer you configure.

Cert-manager itself doesn’t sign certificates magically.
It needs a signing backend — called an Issuer or ClusterIssuer.

There are different types of issuers:

| Issuer Type                      | Signs certificates using                  | Common use case                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **SelfSigned**                   | cert-manager generates a self-signed cert | quick testing                  |
| **CA**                           | cert-manager uses its own in-cluster CA   | internal-only trust            |
| **ACME**                         | public CA like Let’s Encrypt              | internet-facing HTTPS          |
| **Vault / Google CAS / AWS PCA** | external managed CA                       | production-grade private trust |


So if you don’t use AWS PCA, you’ll likely use SelfSigned or CA Issuer, which means:

The certs will be trusted only inside your cluster, not across AWS or your organization.

There’s no audit, no centralized policy, no external trust chain.


## security issue

Effect:
Cert-manager signs using a root CA that lives inside Kubernetes, in a Secret.

🔴 Issues:

No visibility or control from AWS side.

Root CA key is stored in a Kubernetes Secret, which is not secure enough for real PKI.

Rotations, audits, and revocations must be handled manually.

This is why security/compliance teams don’t allow in-cluster CAs for production.

🧩 Step 1: What it means to "trust" a certificate

When your browser or service connects to another server over HTTPS (or mTLS), it checks:

“Do I trust the organization that signed this certificate?”

How does it decide that?
It looks at the Certificate Authority (CA) that signed the certificate.

For example:

If the CA is “Amazon Trust Services” → ✅ trusted.

If the CA is “Let’s Encrypt” → ✅ trusted.

If the CA is “Raunak’s Random Cluster CA” → ❌ not trusted (because nobody knows it).

⚠️ Step 3: Why this causes problems

Now imagine your Ingress, Load Balancer, or an external client (like your browser) connects to your service using that certificate.

It receives:

“Certificate signed by cert-manager Root CA”

But the client says:

“Who is this cert-manager CA? I don’t know this authority.”

So it rejects it with the error:

x509: certificate signed by unknown authority


That’s the same as your browser saying “⚠️ Your connection is not private.”

Because the CA that signed it isn’t part of any trusted CA list that AWS or browsers or systems recognize.

🔐 Step 4: Security problem — CA private key inside Kubernetes

When cert-manager is the CA, it stores the private key (the signing key) in a Kubernetes Secret:

kubectl get secret my-root-ca -o yaml


That means if anyone gets access to your cluster — even read-only access to Secrets — they can:

Extract that key

Use it to sign their own fake certificates

Pretend to be any service in your cluster

That’s a huge risk in production, because the whole “trust” of your TLS system can be forged.

🏢 Step 5: What AWS PCA fixes

AWS PCA fixes both problems:

| Problem                                   | What AWS PCA does                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Certificates not trusted by other systems | PCA is a **central AWS-managed CA** — all AWS services (ALB, EC2, CloudFront, etc.) trust it                   |
| CA key exposed in cluster                 | PCA’s private key is stored **inside AWS**, protected by HSM (Hardware Security Module) — **never leaves AWS** |
| No control / audit                        | AWS CloudTrail logs every issued cert                                                                          |
| No revocation                             | AWS PCA supports certificate revocation lists (CRL) and templates                                              |

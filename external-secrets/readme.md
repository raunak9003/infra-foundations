Part 1 — The mental model (in simple words)

Goal: keep secrets in a secure manager (AWS Secrets Manager/SSM, GCP Secret Manager, etc.) and sync them into Kubernetes as native Secret objects automatically.

Actors:

SecretStore/ClusterSecretStore → how ESO reaches your cloud secret manager (provider + auth).

ExternalSecret → what to fetch (keys, paths) and how to render the resulting Kubernetes Secret.

ESO controller → the operator doing the sync/refresh.



Lets discuss the flow->

provider → ESO reads remote secret → renders/creates a K8s Secret → your Pods consume it via envFrom, env, or as a volume/file.

Refresh: ESO keeps the K8s Secret up to date on a schedule (refreshInterval), so rotations upstream flow into the cluster.


🧩 What is External Secrets Operator (ESO)?

Think of ESO as a bridge between:
👉 your cloud secret manager (like AWS Secrets Manager or GCP Secret Manager)
and
👉 your Kubernetes cluster.

It fetches secrets from the cloud and creates normal Kubernetes Secrets inside your cluster — so your pods can use them just like any other Secret.

🧠 The three main “actors”

Let’s say you have a database password stored in AWS Secrets Manager under the name prod/db/credentials.

You want that password to appear in your cluster as a Kubernetes Secret so your pod can use it.

To make this happen, three things work together:


1️⃣ SecretStore / ClusterSecretStore

➡️ This tells ESO how to connect to your cloud.

Example:
“I’ll use AWS Secrets Manager in us-west-2 region, and I’ll log in using this IAM role.”


```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterSecretStore
metadata:
  name: aws-secrets
spec:
  provider:
    aws:
      service: SecretsManager
      region: us-west-2
      auth:
        jwt:
          serviceAccountRef:
            name: external-secrets
            namespace: external-secrets
```

In simple words:

This is like saying, “Hey ESO, when I say ‘go get a secret,’ here’s which cloud, which region, and which credentials to use.”

2️⃣ ExternalSecret

➡️ This tells ESO what to fetch and how to save it in Kubernetes.


```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: db-secret
  namespace: myapp
spec:
  refreshInterval: 1h
  secretStoreRef:
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
    name: aws-secrets
  target:
    name: myapp-db-secret          # The name of K8s Secret to create
  data:
    - secretKey: username          # Key name inside K8s Secret
      remoteRef:
        key: prod/db/credentials   # Name of secret in AWS
        property: username         # JSON property in AWS secret
    - secretKey: password
      remoteRef:
        key: prod/db/credentials
        property: password
```

In simple words:

“Go to AWS Secrets Manager, open the secret called prod/db/credentials,
pull out username and password, and create a Kubernetes Secret named myapp-db-secret.”

You have a secret called prod/db/credentials that looks like this:

```
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "12345"
}
```

In your ExternalSecret


```
target:
  name: myapp-db-secret
data:
  - secretKey: username
    remoteRef:
      key: prod/db/credentials
      property: username
  - secretKey: password
    remoteRef:
      key: prod/db/credentials
      property: password
```

Here:

secretKey = what key name to use inside Kubernetes Secret.

property = what field to read from the AWS JSON.


3️⃣ ESO Controller

➡️ This is the program running in your cluster that actually does the work.


Reads your ClusterSecretStore to know how to connect to AWS.

Reads your ExternalSecret to know what to fetch.

Talks to AWS Secrets Manager → gets the data.

Creates a normal Kubernetes Secret like this:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: myapp-db-secret
  namespace: myapp
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=       # base64 of “admin”
  password: MTIzNDU=       # base64 of “12345”
```


🔁 The Flow (in real life)

| Step | What Happens                                    | Example                                        |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | You define how to connect to AWS                | `ClusterSecretStore`                           |
| 2️⃣  | You tell ESO what secret to fetch               | `ExternalSecret`                               |
| 3️⃣  | ESO connects to AWS                             | uses IRSA / IAM role                           |
| 4️⃣  | ESO gets secret values                          | `{ "username": "admin", "password": "12345" }` |
| 5️⃣  | ESO creates a Kubernetes Secret                 | `myapp-db-secret`                              |
| 6️⃣  | Your pod mounts or reads it                     | via `envFrom` or `volumeMounts`                |
| 7️⃣  | Every 1 hour (refreshInterval) ESO checks again | if secret changed → updates the K8s Secret     |


## Let’s now explore how the secrets fetched by ESO can be used by your pods in different ways:

👉 as environment variables,
👉 as mounted files,
👉 and in special cases like TLS certs, Docker creds, etc.


### 1️⃣ Using as Environment Variables (envFrom / env)

💡 Why use it:

When your application expects credentials from environment variables (like DB_USER, DB_PASS).

Fast and clean — no file mounting.

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: myapp-env-secrets
  namespace: myapp
spec:
  refreshInterval: 30m
  secretStoreRef:
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
    name: aws-sm
  target:
    name: myapp-env-secret
  data:
    - secretKey: DB_USER
      remoteRef:
        key: prod/db/credentials
        property: username
    - secretKey: DB_PASS
      remoteRef:
        key: prod/db/credentials
        property: password
```

ESO creates:
```yaml
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: myapp-env-secret
data:
  DB_USER: YWRtaW4=
  DB_PASS: MTIzNDU=
```

## 📁 2️⃣ Using as Files (via Volume Mounts)

This is used when:

The app needs secrets as files (e.g., config files, certs, license.json, etc.)

You want to mount one or many secret keys into a directory.

A. Mount the entire Secret as a directory
```yaml
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: MTIzNDU=
  license.json: eyJrZXkiOiAidmFsdWUifQ==
```

Pod volume:

```yaml
directory-beffe-service-account:
    as: volume
    type: file
    mountPath: /app/beffe
    name: credentials.json
    remoteref: data
```


## Mount only one key as a file (using subPath)


```yaml
volumes:
  - name: license-vol
    secret:
      secretName: private-ai-license
      items:
        - key: license.json
          path: license.json
volumeMounts:
  - name: license-vol
    mountPath: /app/license/license.json
    subPath: license.json
    readOnly: true
```


i noticed that for externalsecret of type `file`  usually dont define the and the reason is most of the times those of type of secrets are being stored as plain string and not as key values.pair.


now why is it so??

1️⃣ What “string secret” actually means

In AWS Secrets Manager (or GCP Secret Manager), you can store secrets in two formats:

A. String secret

→ The whole secret value is just one big string.

```
-----BEGIN LICENSE-----
eyJsaWNlbnNlX2lkIjoiYWJjZCIsInNpZ25hdHVyZSI6InNvbWVfYmFzZTY0X2Jsb2I...
-----END LICENSE-----
```
B. JSON secret

→ The value is a JSON object with multiple fields.
```
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "12345",
  "url": "jdbc://database-url"
}
```
## 🧩 2️⃣ Why some secrets are stored as plain strings

| Secret Type                    | Example Content                       | Why stored as plain string                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 **License file**            | multi-line `.json` or text            | your app expects a single file (not multiple keys) |
| 🔑 **TLS cert or private key** | `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ...`     | must be a single PEM file                          |
| 📜 **K8s Docker config**       | JSON blob like `{ "auths": ... }`     | the JSON itself is the file                        |
| 🧩 **Encryption key**          | `MIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASC...` | single base64 value                                |
| 💾 **Any blob / binary**       | compressed or encoded text            | not meaningful to split                            |


## now lets discuss pn mount path and subpath

When you mount a Kubernetes Secret, it becomes a volume inside your pod.

Each key inside the Secret becomes a file.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: MTIzNDU=

```
If you mount it as a volume:


```yaml
volumes:
  - name: creds
    secret:
      secretName: my-secret
volumeMounts:
  - name: creds
    mountPath: /app/secret
```

Inside the container you’ll see:

```
/app/secret/username
/app/secret/password
```
✅ Each key → one file.

2️⃣ mountPath: where the secret appears inside your container

This is the directory or file path inside the container where Kubernetes will “place” the mounted data.

Whatever is inside your Secret will show up at that path.


```
mountPath: /data/config

```
means everything inside your Secret will appear under /data/config.



3️⃣ subPath: mount just one file from the Secret

By default, if you mount the entire Secret, all keys appear as files in a directory.

But sometimes your app expects a single file, not a folder.

That’s where subPath helps.


lets say we have a secret as->

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: MTIzNDU=

```

and we want only password instead of username 

then in such cases we need to define subpath.

example of implementation
```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: tls
    mountPath: /etc/tls/cert.pem
    subPath: cert.pem
  - name: tls
    mountPath: /etc/tls/key.pem
    subPath: key.pem
```


### now i have one doubt that if we set mountpath: /etc/tls and subpath as cert.pem then what is the issue??

```yaml
mountPath: /etc/tls
subPath: cert.pem
```
💥 What this actually tells Kubernetes

Take only one file (cert.pem) from the Secret,
and mount it as a single file at the path /etc/tls inside the container.


So K8s treats /etc/tls as a file, not a directory.


so correct way is->

```yaml
mountPath: /app/license/license.json
subPath: license.json
```
